        <p>In the darkness of the room two yellow eyes light up. A low growl can be heard as the yellow eyes rise up and slowly approach you. You nervously take a slow step back and the lion begins running towards you. The lion leaps on top of you and you knocks you down, It stands above you and growls with spit and drool falling on top of your face. The lion opens it mouth and it's sharp teeth extend towards you. </p>
